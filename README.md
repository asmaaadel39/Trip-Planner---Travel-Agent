# Trip-Planner---Travel-Agent

During my three-month internship as a Data Scientist, I focused on developing a travel agent, specifically concentrating on multi-agent synchronization. ✈️✨
Key achievements include:
The development of two agents: the Google Agent and the YouTube Agent.
In-depth learning about Transformers and Reinforcement Learning to enhance our AI system.
Gaining hands-on experience with OpenAI API, including knowledge retrieval, code interpretation, and function calling.
