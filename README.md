# Trip-Planner---Travel-Agent

During my three-month internship as a Data Scientist, I focused on developing a travel agent, specifically concentrating on multi-agent synchronization. ✈️✨
Key achievements include:
The development of two agents: the Google Agent and the YouTube Agent.
In-depth learning about Transformers and Reinforcement Learning to enhance our AI system.
Gaining hands-on experience with OpenAI API, including knowledge retrieval, code interpretation, and function calling.
As a Data Scientist, I developed a smart recommendation system that crafts personalized travel plans for agents, simplifying decision-making and enhancing the travel experience. ✈️✨
The system first gathers essential information to generate the plan, such as destination, city, date, interests, and companions, before creating a suitable itinerary for the user. 📅🤔
To achieve this, we developed two agents: the Google Agent and the YouTube Agent.
For the Google Agent:
- I collected data from the web using web scraping techniques and gathered additional insights from LLMs like Gemini. 🌐
- The text processing involved cleaning the text and removing stop words, laying the groundwork for deeper analysis. 🧹
- Leveraging NLP techniques, I conducted text mining using Named Entity Recognition (NER) with spaCy and NLTK to extract key information, including activities, locations, and cities. 🏞️
- Developed a custom rule-based text extraction pipeline using SpaCy's pre-trained model, specifically focusing on extracting activities from the text. 🔍
- Additionally, I utilized LocationTagger to automatically identify countries, cities, and regions from the textual data, enhancing location-based analytics and improving the efficiency of the extraction process. 🌍
- All data was saved in a database for future plan creation. 💾
For the YouTube Agent:
- Accessed the YouTube API to search and filter results to gather videos related to travel. 📹
- Extracted transcripts from all collected videos. 📝
- Text processing involved cleaning the transcripts and removing stop words to prepare for deeper analysis. 🧼
- Analyzed the transcripts using LLaMA to extract key information, including activities, locations, and countries. 📊
During my 3 month-internship at Tabaani , I gained invaluable insights into data science and delved deeper into crucial concepts such as the difference between AI agents and RAG, attention mechanisms, transformers, NLP, NER (Named Entity Recognition), NEL (Named Entity Linking), and LLMs.
